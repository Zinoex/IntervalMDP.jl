We choose in particular to  store the transition matrices in the compressed sparse column (CSC) format. This is a format that is widely used in Julia and other languages, and is supported by many linear algebra operations. It consists of three arrays: colptr, rowval and nzval. The colptr array stores the indices of the first non-zero value in each column. The rowval array stores the row indices of the non-zero values, and the nzval array stores the non-zero values. We choose this format, since source states are on the columns (see IntervalProbabilities for more information about the structure of the transition probability matrices).

For a more in-depth introduction, see the CUDA C++ Programming Guide. The CUDA framework is Single-Instruction Multiple-Thread (SIMT) parallel execution platform and Application Programming Interface. This is in contrast to Single-Instruction Multiple-Data where all data must be processed homogeneously without control flow. SIMT makes CUDA more flexible for heterogeneous processing and control flow. The smallest execution unit in CUDA is a thread, which is a sequential processing of instructions. A thread is uniquely identified by its thread index, which allows indexing into the global data for parallel processing. A group of 32 threads[2] is called a warp, which will be executed mostly synchronously on a streaming multiprocessor. If control flow makes threads in a wrap diverge, instructions may need to be decoded twice and executed in two separate cycles. Due to this synchronous behavior, data can be shared in registers between threads in a warp for maximum performance. A collection of (up to) 1024 threads is called a block, and this is the largest aggregation that can be synchronized. Furthermore, threads in a block share the appropriately named shared memory. This is memory that is stored locally on the streaming multiprocessor for fast access. Note that shared memory is unintuitively faster than local memory (not to be confused with registers) due to local memory being allocated in device memory. Finally, a collection of (up to) 65536 blocks is called the grid of a kernel, which is the set of instructions to be executed. The grid is singular as only a single ever exists per launched kernel. Hence, if more blocks are necessary to process the amount of data, then a grid-strided loop or multiple kernels are necessary.
